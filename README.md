## Responsive design  

The site contains three main areas / sections: the header, the Flaghip Project and Featured Work. There are 3 breakpoints:  

  - small: < 450px  
    - At small screen sizes, the headers are smaller and the flexbox design will keep all content in a single column  
  - medium: between 451px - 1119px  
    - this is the default size. Default header text size. The content layout is controlled by flexbox layout (single column in all my tests)  
  - large: >=1120px  
    - at large screen size, the order of the flexbox layout changes. The FeaturedWork section is placed in a side column, with the Flagship section moved 
to the right, larger area of the screen.  
    - additional padding is also added to all containers, so that the content remains centered on the screen and does not get absurdly large.
